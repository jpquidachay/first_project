                    <li>
                        I was born in Galloway Township located in southern New Jersey.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I currently reside in the city of brotherly love, Philadelphia!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One goal I have in life is to travel to as many places throughout the world as possible and experience different cultures!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The best job I've had so far would be the elementary school teacher job I most recently had.
                        I was a first-grade teacher and although I will miss teaching and working with children,
                        I am excited for new opportunities and learning new skills that will hopefully lead to a new career!
